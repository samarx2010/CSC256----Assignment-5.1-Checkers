# CSC256----Assignment-5.1-Checkers
For this assignment, we will make a functional checkers game.  Populate a board with checkers pieces and enable the board to allow a user to move pieces around the board. For our purposes in this assignment, the movements should be restricted to one square at a time.  This is part of the UAT curriculum.
